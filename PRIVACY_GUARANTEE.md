# üîí Secure Heart - Privacy-First Guarantee

## ‚úÖ ZERO Data Sharing with Apple

Your Secure Heart app has been configured with **privacy-first principles**:

### What the App DOES NOT Do:
- ‚ùå **NO data written to Apple Health**
- ‚ùå **NO data sent to Apple servers**
- ‚ùå **NO analytics or telemetry**
- ‚ùå **NO cloud sync**
- ‚ùå **NO reports to Apple**
- ‚ùå **NO external data sharing**

### How Data Flows (100% Local):
```
Watch Sensors ‚Üí Watch App ‚Üí iPhone App
      ‚Üë              ‚Üë           ‚Üë
   Local only    Local only   Local only
```

### Technical Implementation:

#### iPhone App:
- **HealthKit DISABLED**: No reading from or writing to Apple Health
- **Data Source**: Only receives data from Watch via WatchConnectivity
- **Storage**: All data stored locally on device only
- **Authorization**: `requestAuthorization()` explicitly disabled

#### Watch App:
- **Read-Only Sensors**: Only reads heart rate from Watch sensors
- **NO HealthKit Writing**: `toShare: nil` - cannot write to Apple Health
- **Local Processing**: All calculations done locally
- **WatchConnectivity**: Only sends to paired iPhone (local connection)

### Data Lifecycle:
1. **Collection**: Watch sensors detect heart rate
2. **Processing**: Watch app calculates stats locally
3. **Transfer**: Data sent to iPhone via WatchConnectivity (local only)
4. **Display**: iPhone app shows real-time data
5. **Storage**: Data stored in app memory only (not Apple Health)

### Privacy Logs:
The app now includes privacy logging:
- `üîí [iPhone] HealthKit authorization DISABLED - Privacy-first mode`
- `üîí [WATCH] HealthKit read-only authorization granted - NO data written to Apple Health`

## Your Guarantee:
**Your heart rate data NEVER leaves your devices and NEVER goes to Apple's servers.**

All data remains completely private between your Apple Watch and iPhone only.
