## üè• PROJECT OVERVIEW

**SecureHeart MVP1** - A privacy-first Apple Watch heart rate monitoring app that keeps all data local to user devices with zero external transmission.

### Core Mission:
- **Privacy-first**: Apple Watch heart rate monitoring app
- **Local-only**: Keeps all data on user devices with zero external transmission
- **POTS-focused**: Designed specifically for people with POTS and heart rate conditions
- **Emergency alerts**: Firebase-based emergency contact system with confirmation dialogs

## üé® UI/UX DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### **Apple Best Practices - ALWAYS FOLLOW:**
- **Human Interface Guidelines** - Follow Apple's HIG religiously
- **Simple & Streamlined** - Every interface should be clean and intuitive
- **Privacy First** - User privacy is paramount in all design decisions
- **Accessibility** - Support VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, and assistive technologies
- **Native Patterns** - Use standard iOS/watchOS UI patterns and controls

### **Design Philosophy:**
- **Minimal & Purposeful** - No feature bloat, every element serves a purpose
- **User Control** - Users control their data, sharing, and privacy settings
- **Secure by Design** - Privacy and security built into every feature
- **Medical-Grade** - Reliable, accurate, appropriate for health monitoring

## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE & PRIVACY

### **Data Storage:**
- **Local-only**: All heart rate data stays on iPhone/Apple Watch
- **No cloud sync**: Zero external data transmission for health data
- **Firebase exception**: Only for anonymous emergency contact linking
- **HealthKit integration**: Read-only access for heart rate sensors

### **Privacy Implementation:**
- **Anonymous authentication**: Firebase anonymous auth for emergency contacts
- **First name only**: Never store full names or identifying information
- **User consent**: Explicit permission for all data sharing
- **No analytics**: No third-party analytics or tracking

## üö® EMERGENCY CONTACT SYSTEM

### **Architecture:**
- **Firebase-only**: No Twilio/SendGrid - use Firebase + native iOS messaging
- **Simplified flow**: Anonymous auth ‚Üí invitation codes ‚Üí bidirectional linking
- **Native messaging**: iOS MessageUI for contact invitations
- **Confirmation dialogs**: 15-second countdown before sending emergency alerts

### **POTS-Specific Features:**
- **Configurable thresholds**: High/Low BPM customizable
- **Rapid increase detection**: +30 BPM in 10 minutes (POTS diagnostic criteria)
- **Extreme spike alerts**: +40 BPM in 5 minutes
- **Rate limiting**: Max 3 alerts per hour to prevent spam

## üì± TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### **Platform Support:**
- **Apple Watch Series 4+** and newer
- **iOS 15+** for iPhone companion
- **watchOS 8+** for Watch app
- **HealthKit read-only** access for heart rate sensors

### **Dependencies:**
- **Firebase SDK**: Auth, Firestore, Functions, Messaging
- **Native frameworks**: HealthKit, MessageUI, Contacts, ContactsUI
- **No third-party**: Avoid external dependencies beyond Firebase

## üîß DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

### **Code Quality:**
- **SwiftUI-first**: Use SwiftUI for all new UI development
- **Clean architecture**: Separate ViewModels, Models, and Services
- **Error handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Performance**: Minimal battery impact, efficient data processing

### **File Organization:**
- **Feature-based**: Group files by feature, not file type
- **Clear naming**: Descriptive file and variable names
- **Documentation**: Comment complex logic, especially health-related calculations

## üß™ TESTING & VALIDATION

### **Health Data Accuracy:**
- **Real device testing**: Always test on real Apple Watch for heart rate accuracy
- **Medical validation**: Ensure thresholds align with medical research
- **POTS research**: Base features on current POTS diagnostic criteria

### **Privacy Verification:**
- **No external transmission**: Verify no health data leaves the device
- **Anonymous testing**: Ensure Firebase system truly anonymous
- **Data audit**: Regular checks that only necessary data is stored

## üöÄ MVP1 SCOPE

### **In Scope:**
- Real-time heart rate monitoring with large, readable BPM display
- Color-coded heart rate zones (Blue: <80, Green: 80-120, Yellow: 120-150, Red: >150)
- Multiple watch face themes (Classic, Minimal, Chunky, Numbers Only, Watch Face)
- Pulse animation synchronized to heart rate
- 60-minute local heart rate history
- Emergency contact system with Firebase backend
- POTS-aware threshold detection
- iPhone companion app with dashboard and settings

### **Out of Scope for MVP1:**
- Cloud synchronization
- Share with healthcare providers
- Custom heart rate zones
- Notification alerts
- Workout integration
- Historical data beyond 60 minutes
- Complications (due to refresh limitations)

### **Success Criteria:**
- Reliable heart rate display within 10 seconds
- Smooth navigation between watch faces
- Successful data sync between Watch and iPhone
- Export functionality works correctly
- Zero external data transmission verified
- App passes security review
- Stable performance during extended use

## üîÑ CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

### **‚úÖ Completed:**
- Firebase-only emergency contact system (no Twilio/SendGrid)
- Native iOS messaging for contact invitations
- iOS Contacts integration for easy contact selection
- Location sharing preferences with user consent
- Emergency threshold settings (POTS-aware)
- Confirmation dialogs with 15-second countdown
- Anonymous Firebase authentication
- Bidirectional contact linking system

### **üéØ Active Development:**
- UI cleanup and streamlining
- Apple best practices implementation
- Privacy-first design patterns

## üìù DEVELOPMENT NOTES

### **When Working on SecureHeart:**
1. **Always prioritize privacy** - Question any data collection or transmission
2. **Test on real devices** - Simulators don't provide accurate heart rate data
3. **Follow Apple HIG** - Every UI element should feel native and intuitive
4. **POTS-aware design** - Consider the specific needs of POTS patients
5. **Medical accuracy** - Ensure all health-related features are medically sound

### **Code Review Checklist:**
- [ ] No health data transmitted externally
- [ ] UI follows Apple Human Interface Guidelines
- [ ] Accessibility support implemented
- [ ] Error handling graceful and user-friendly
- [ ] Performance impact minimal
- [ ] Privacy settings respected
- [ ] POTS-specific features medically accurate
