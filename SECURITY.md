# SecureHeart Security Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the SecureHeart app to protect sensitive medical data and ensure user privacy.

## Security Features

### 1. Credential Management
- **Firebase credentials** are no longer stored in version control
- Credentials are loaded from secure sources in priority order:
  1. iOS Keychain (most secure)
  2. Local configuration file (development only)
  3. Bundle template (placeholder only)
- All sensitive configuration files are excluded via `.gitignore`

### 2. User Privacy & Anonymization
- **Anonymous User IDs**: Device identifiers are never sent to servers
- User IDs are generated using SHA-256 hash with salt
- Salt is unique per device and stored in Keychain
- Original device ID cannot be reverse-engineered from the hash

### 3. Medical Data Encryption
- All medical data is encrypted using **AES-256-GCM**
- Encryption keys are generated per-device and stored in iOS Keychain
- Data is encrypted at rest and before any network transmission
- Includes:
  - Heart rate readings
  - Emergency events
  - Medical notes
  - User health patterns

### 4. Keychain Security
- All sensitive data stored with `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly`
- Data is only accessible when device is unlocked
- Data does not sync to iCloud Keychain
- Automatic cleanup on app uninstall

### 5. Privacy Consent Management
- Explicit consent required for:
  - Health data collection
  - Emergency contact notifications
  - Cloud synchronization
  - Analytics collection
- Consent audit trail maintained
- GDPR-compliant data deletion available

## Implementation Details

### ConfigurationManager.swift
Handles secure loading and validation of configuration:
```swift
// Load configuration securely
let config = ConfigurationManager.shared.loadFirebaseConfig()

// Get anonymous user ID
let userID = ConfigurationManager.shared.getAnonymousUserID()
```

### MedicalDataEncryption.swift
Provides encryption for all medical data:
```swift
// Encrypt sensitive data
let encrypted = try MedicalDataEncryption.shared.encrypt(data)

// Decrypt when needed
let decrypted = try MedicalDataEncryption.shared.decrypt(encryptedData)
```

### PrivacyConsentManager.swift
Manages user consent and privacy preferences:
```swift
// Check consent
if PrivacyConsentManager.shared.hasConsent(for: "health_data_collection") {
    // Collect health data
}

// Clear all data (GDPR compliance)
PrivacyConsentManager.shared.clearAllData()
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Initial Setup
1. Copy `GoogleService-Info-Template.plist` to `GoogleService-Info.plist`
2. Fill in your Firebase credentials in the new file
3. The new file will be automatically ignored by git

### 2. Development Setup
```bash
# Copy template file
cp SecureHeart/GoogleService-Info-Template.plist SecureHeart/GoogleService-Info.plist
cp "SecureHeart Watch App/GoogleService-Info-Template.plist" "SecureHeart Watch App/GoogleService-Info.plist"

# Edit with your credentials
# NEVER commit the actual GoogleService-Info.plist files
```

### 3. Production Setup
For production deployments:
1. Store credentials in CI/CD secrets
2. Inject during build process
3. Never store production credentials in repository

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never commit credentials** - Always check git status before committing
2. **Use template files** - Commit templates, not actual config files
3. **Rotate keys regularly** - Update Firebase API keys periodically
4. **Review permissions** - Ensure minimal required permissions

### For Users
1. **Grant minimal permissions** - Only allow necessary data access
2. **Keep app updated** - Security patches in updates
3. **Use device passcode** - Enhances Keychain security
4. **Review emergency contacts** - Keep contact list current

## Compliance

### HIPAA Considerations
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Audit trails for data access
- User authentication required
- Minimal data collection principle

### GDPR Compliance
- Explicit consent mechanisms
- Right to erasure (data deletion)
- Data portability options
- Privacy by design principles

## Security Audit Checklist

- [ ] Firebase credentials removed from repository
- [ ] .gitignore properly configured
- [ ] Anonymous user IDs implemented
- [ ] Medical data encryption active
- [ ] Keychain storage configured
- [ ] Consent management operational
- [ ] Security documentation updated

## Incident Response

In case of security concerns:
1. Immediately rotate all API keys
2. Review access logs in Firebase Console
3. Notify affected users if data breach suspected
4. Document incident and response
