# Firebase Package Fix

## The Problem
The project currently has `FirebaseFirestoreCombine-Community` but needs `FirebaseFirestore` (the main package).

## Quick Fix in Xcode

1. **Open Xcode project**: `SecureHeart.xcodeproj`

2. **Navigate to Package Dependencies**:
   - Click on "SecureHeart" project (top of navigator)
   - Click "Package Dependencies" tab

3. **Modify Firebase Package**:
   - Find "firebase-ios-sdk" package
   - Click on it and then click "+" to add more products
   - **Add these packages**:
     - ✅ `FirebaseFirestore` (the main one - this is missing!)
     - ✅ `FirebaseCore` (base package - also missing!)

4. **Remove if needed**:
   - You can remove `FirebaseFirestoreCombine-Community` if you want (we don't need it)

## What Should Be Installed
- ✅ `FirebaseAuth`
- ✅ `FirebaseCore` ← **ADD THIS**
- ✅ `FirebaseFirestore` ← **ADD THIS**
- ✅ `FirebaseFunctions`
- ✅ `FirebaseMessaging`
- ❓ `FirebaseFirestoreCombine-Community` ← **Can remove this**

## After Adding Packages
The app should build successfully without errors.
